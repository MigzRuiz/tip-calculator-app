## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS
- Gulp
- Netlify

### What I learned

Making this project marks my return to learning web development again. I decided to go back to basics and do the project with HTML, CSS, JS. I've been stuck in tutorial hell before and this is a nice change of pace because this is the first time that I'm building an app on my own. I learned a lot about Gulp as well as I've only used other bundlers before. 

This project inspired me to doing more.

### Continued development

In the future, I'd like to convert this app into a REACT App to challenge myself to learn and be comfortable with the framework.
